- Dictionary -> is a list where each item has a key and a value, therefore allowing you to get items value's from their keys

## Strengths
- Allows you to store data without having to remember the index, especially if they move around
- Easy to write and clean up code
- Improves readability of code
- Very fast -> it's an implementation of a hash table

## Limitiations
- Unordered (well it's supposed to be ordered nowadays but it's really weird)
- Take up alot more space and memory, but doesnt matter much as memory isnt expensive anymore
